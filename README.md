# snake-game
A simple snake game using react

Do "yarn install" after navigating to the folder to install node modules.
Then do "yarn start" to get the app running.

Use arrow keys to play.

The snake will not die or grow. React components are used to display the score and snake movement is updated each time an arrow is pressed.
